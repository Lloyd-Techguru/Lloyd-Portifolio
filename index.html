    <h2>About Lloyd:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><h3>BACKGROUND</h3></li>
            <P>I am currently, studying bachelor of commerce (Sales and Marketing) at the university of Nairobi,
                my interest in sales and marketing has helped me to develop and horn my interests as an entrepreneur 
                and an online bettor with experience spanning over 4 years.</P>
            <p>I have been privilidged enough to work for two companies: Spectrum Newtwork international and VASPRO
                as the sales executive in both companies. Most of my time has been spent in pursuing my entrepreneurial
                journey as I have always admired to make a great impact to humanity that supersedes most companies visions
                 and mission which is to generate profit at the expense of everything else.</p>
            <p>My desire to join Moringa, was motivated by my desire to escape the 8am-5pm rat race where an individual
                gets to earn based on the amount of hours they work rather than on the value they bring to the market place
                be it skills,accumulated experience or connections. Going through life as an entrepreneur I have always known that
                profits supersede wages and my efforts are geared towards gaining skills that can enable me to gain
                a competitive edge to compete universally.</p>
        <li><h3>My Interest,hobbies and Skills.</h3></li>
                <p>I have interests in learning coding and software programming languages.</p>
                <p>Generating new business ideas that can provide solutions to meet the market demand</p>
                <p>I have deep love for maths and understanding how data and statistics can be well organised and analysed
                    to enable us to make future decisions.</p>
